# Tac Scanner

Part of standard NASF equipment – each Spacer has one – the Tac Scanner is a general-purpose device used primarily to scout unfamiliar areas, make a detailed examination of living
things, and record and review technical data.

In gameplay terms, the cardboard Tac Scanner features a double red-foil window used for
a variety of mechanics across the whole Enormity experience. These include, but are not
limited to:

- Determining Blip movements during the Intruder Phase (see Blip Patrols on p. 30)
- Flatlining (see Dying on p. 29)
- Determining random coordinates (see Coordinates on p. 40)
- Looking for secrets with the ‘magnifying glass’ second window (see Secrets on
  p. 42)
- And much more…
