# Unique Speciment

Not all baseline Intruders were made equal. Some
rare specimens are stronger, faster or just straight
weirder. Whenever a Unique Specimen is revealed,
draw a random Unique Specimen card of the Intruder type, place it on one of the numbered spaces on
the Intruder Sheet and place a corresponding numbered token underneath the standee or miniature
instead.

Unique Specimen cards modify the basic stats and
behavior of that baseline Intruder. The modification
may be straightforward, for example, the Intruder
may have a bonus to Speed or AT, but may also be
more complex, like a new AI Protocol that replaces
one of the basic Protocols for that given Intruder, a
passive trait or something else.
