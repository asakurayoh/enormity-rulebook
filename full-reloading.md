# Full Reloading

Reloading is an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action that allows
you to reload a currently equipped Weapon to its
maximum ammo capacity.

- Some Weapons (with the **Heavy** keyword)
  can only be reloaded by the Full Reload action.
- You may fully reload a weapon even if it still
  has some Ammo tokens.
- A Full Reload action **will not restore** used
  Charges ![Used Charge Icon](svg/used-charges.svg) **or remove** a Discharge Status ![Status Token Icon](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg).

**Note:** As an Adrenaline action, Full Reloading raises
your Adrenaline and allows you to leave Spacer tokens!
