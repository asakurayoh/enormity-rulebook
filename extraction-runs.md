# Extraction Runs

During an **Extraction Run**, your group of Spacers
will venture into one of the *Shepherd’s* locations with
the general goal of scavenging gear, tech and en-
grams, and a more specific objective, like restarting
the life support systems, downloading the deck’s
map or simply finding a way deeper into the derelict
hulk. Each time you will face mounting resistance
from alien Intruders, which you will have to fight,
or evade. **Manage your ammo clips and the noise
you make carefully, and shoot to kill.**

As the Countdown Marker inevitably ticks down to-
wards **zero hour ![Zero Hour Icon](svg/icon-zero-hour.svg)**, the run will become more and
more dangerous. You choose when to **extract** – but
be careful, it’s harder than it sounds!

## The Goal of a Run

During an Extraction Run, each player controls
a Spacer, while the Intruders are controlled by a set
of automated mechanics, i.e. the game itself.
You want to complete your goals and extract (see
Extraction on p. 24), while the Intruders will try
to eliminate you.

An extraction run is considered a **success** if at least
one Spacer makes it out alive (extracts). Don’t worry,
death is not necessarily final (see Death and Life Spares
on p. 42) and as long as you have time crystals, you
may repeat a **failed run** (see Time Crystals on p. 42).
Still, in the full game, a campaign can very much end
in failure if you allow multiple defeats to accrue.

## When to go on a Run?

In the full game, you will be prompted to go on an
extraction run by your current **Course card** or, if
you’re playing a one-off session, you will simply
**choose a location** to venture into. In the Dark Side
of the Sun demo, the scenario cards will prompt you
on when to go on a run, starting with Demo card 01.

## Preparing a Run

To prepare an extraction run, follow the steps
presented in this section:

1. Perform Location Setup
2. Choose Loadouts

## 1. Preparing Location Setup

**1. Open the Location and Intruder Books:** Based on
your Course card or chosen one-off Location, open
the appropriate Location Book on the indicated
page(s). Based on the Location’s ecology, open the
Intruder Book on the appropriate Intruder’s page.
Open the Mythos Book on the page indicated in the
Location Book.

**2. Unique Specimen cards:** Take the Unique
Specimen cards corresponding to the current
Intruder, shuffle them facedown and place near
the Intruder page.

**3. Spacer tokens and Power dice:** Place the Spacer
Pool board near the Location book. Place the Spacer
tokens and Power dice within reach of all players.

**4. Create Blip Pool:** Take all the Blips and shuffle
them facedown. This is the Blip Pool.

**5. Engram Pool:** Take all the Engrams and shuffle
them in an opaque container. This is the Engram Pool.

**6. Countdown Track:** Place the Countdown Track
below the Location Book (see Countdown Track on
p. 13) and place the Countdown Marker on space
‘9’ of the track. Place the Extraction Marker on the
space specified by your current Course 

*(note: in the Demo, you will find this space in the
Mythos Book, in the section corresponding
to your current mission)*.

The rest of setup proceeds according to the instructions you will find in the Mythos Book:

**7. Scanner Decks:** Take the Scanner cards, divide
them by color into three decks (white, red and black),
then shuffle those decks and place them near the
Countdown Track.

**8. Blips and Intruders: **If the scenario doesn’t explicitly show **starting Blip placement** intersections
(see the Board Spaces, Adjacency, Lines, Intersections and Out-of-Bounds Spaces box below), place
**exactly one Blip per spawn point cluster** (see
Spawn Point Clusters on p. 10), with the direction
arrow pointing towards most Spacers. Place Blips
on the indicated spaces of the Countdown Track,
if any. Place any Intruders on the indicated spaces.

*Note: The first Dark Side of the Sun run shows starting Blip
placement!*

**9. Loot Deck, Loot Caches and Engrams:** First,
take the appropriate Loot Deck (each section of the
ship has its own unique deck!) out of its envelope,
place the Loot Cache Lid card to the side, shuffle the
rest of the cards, and place them on the Loot Dispenser (see the Loot Dispenser box). Then, place the
Loot Cache Lid card on top. Place the Loot Cache
tokens on indicated spaces. Draw random Engram
tokens and place them on the indicated spaces.

**10. Closed Doors:** Place the Closed Door standees
on indicated spaces.

**11. Discoveries:** Place Discovery tokens on the
indicated spaces, faceup or facedown, depending
on the Setup Instructions. If the Setup instructions
refer to a Discovery card deck, place the deck near
the Countdown Track.

*Note that in the first demo run you only setup
fixed Discoveries!*

**12. Other components:** At this point place any other components mentioned in the location setup on
the indicated spaces, intersections or areas. This
may include special Objective tokens or additional
Extraction Points. For example, in the Demo you will
place Anomalous Reading tokens.

When you’re done with Location Setup, you may
proceed to choosing your Loadouts.

> - [Closed Doors](closed-doors.md)

## 2. Choosing Loadouts

Knowing what you’re up against, you may choose
your Loadouts.

**1. Characters and Suits:** Each player takes a *Memento* card and a rubicon connector, and then selects their oversized character card and their suit
card. They then take the standee or plastic figure
that match the character/suit.

**2. Action Cards:** Each Character card and each Suit
card provides players with different **partial Action
cards**. To find your partial Action cards, simply flip
your Character and Suit cards: on the back you will
find a list of three partial action cards, for a total of
6 cards.

Each player takes their 6 partial Action cards and
combines them, to create **three double-sided
sleeved Action cards (see the Action Cards box
below)**.

**3. Player Boards:** After creating their Action cards,
players connect their Character and Suit cards using the rubicon connector to create a **player board**.
They then take the three **special plastic indicators**, and place them on their player board.

In the demo, Vitals ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) start on space ‘9’, Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) 
starts on space ‘0’, and the starting space of
Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) is indicated on the Character card.

**4. Gear:** Once your Spacer is ready, choose the
Gear you will take with you on the run, noting the
number of Gear you can carry in hand ![Hand Slots Icon](svg/icon-hand-slots.svg), as support ![Slots Icon](svg/icon-slots.svg "Slots"), and in your backpack ![Backpack Icon](svg/icon-backpack.svg "Slots") (this is usually dictated by your Suit card).

*In the demo’s first run, your Loadouts have been
chosen for you!*

**5. Stratagems:** Choose 2 from your available Stratagem cards and place them near the Location Book,
facedown.

*For the demo’s first run, we suggest you use **Tactical Redeployment** and **Morpheus Protocol**.*

**6. Place Spacers on the board:** Finally, place your
Spacer standees or miniatures on the spaces indicated in the Mythos Book. Once you’re done, you’re
ready to go!

**7. Choose Priority Target:** Chosen Spacer receives
the **Priority Target/Last to Noise Marker** ![Priority Target Icon](img/icon-target.png).
