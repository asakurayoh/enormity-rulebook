# Extraction Runs

During an **Extraction Run**, your group of Spacers
will venture into one of the *Shepherd’s* locations with
the general goal of scavenging gear, tech and en-
grams, and a more specific objective, like restarting
the life support systems, downloading the deck’s
map or simply finding a way deeper into the derelict
hulk. Each time you will face mounting resistance
from alien Intruders, which you will have to fight,
or evade. **Manage your ammo clips and the noise
you make carefully, and shoot to kill.**

As the Countdown Marker inevitably ticks down to-
wards **zero hour ![Zero Hour Icon](svg/icon-zero-hour.svg)**, the run will become more and
more dangerous. You choose when to **extract** – but
be careful, it’s harder than it sounds!

## The Goal of a Run

During an Extraction Run, each player controls
a Spacer, while the Intruders are controlled by a set
of automated mechanics, i.e. the game itself.
You want to complete your goals and extract (see
Extraction on p. 24), while the Intruders will try
to eliminate you.

An extraction run is considered a **success** if at least
one Spacer makes it out alive (extracts). Don’t worry,
death is not necessarily final (see Death and Life Spares
on p. 42) and as long as you have time crystals, you
may repeat a **failed run** (see Time Crystals on p. 42).
Still, in the full game, a campaign can very much end
in failure if you allow multiple defeats to accrue.

## When to go on a Run?

In the full game, you will be prompted to go on an
extraction run by your current **Course card** or, if
you’re playing a one-off session, you will simply
**choose a location** to venture into. In the Dark Side
of the Sun demo, the scenario cards will prompt you
on when to go on a run, starting with Demo card 01.
