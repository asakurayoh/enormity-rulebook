# What Is Enormity?

**Enormity** is a 1-4 player extraction dungeon crawler with epic boss battles that can be enjoyed 
in oneshot sittings or as an interconnected modular campaign with enough sandbox content to be 
replayed virtually infinitely. All that in an immersive, reactive and seamless science fiction open world.

In **Enormity**, you will explore a massive NASF (_National Aeronautics and Space Force_) ship, _The Shepherd_, 
moving from area to area, scavenging loot and knowledge, avoiding or fighting terrible intruder enemies, 
including boss-type alien lifeforms. You will play as established characters or create your own, develop 
them through branching progression trees, gather engrams to convert into resources, weaponize your finds, 
develop technology, try to piece together alien lore, and craft new weapons, gear, and even new suits, as 
well as customize your loadouts. Oh, and above all else, you will try to survive.

**Enormity** is not a legacy game, but it uses some legacy systems, like gradual mechanic introduction, 
secret content, re-usable stickers, and consequences for subsequent plays and campaign playthroughs 
(no component destruction though!).

## Join Us!

**Enormity**, like all our previous games, is a crowdfunding endeavor. Games like this – bold, brave, 
big, rich in content and innovation, delivering hundreds of hours of engrossing gameplay, gripping high 
quality narratives, ground-breaking concepts and exquisitely detailed miniatures, would never see the light 
of day without people like You. If Enormity looks like something you think you’d like, consider supporting 
us on Kickstarter for the best price, exclusive content and an opportunity to be part of something bigger 
than yourself. Something Enormous. Thank you!
