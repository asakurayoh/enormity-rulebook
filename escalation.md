# Escalation

Intruders get progressively harder as the Incursion
goes on because power begets power. Such is the
effect of Escalation, a central Enormity mechanic.
Escalation will make the Intruder tougher by adding
higher level cards to the BP deck, and more deadly
by swapping AI cards in the AI deck.

**Note:** If the Total Power of your Attack is **lower
than** the AT value of the targeted BP card, you
**failed** to wound the Intruder. Place the BP card you
targeted on top of the BP discard pile and **do not
perform Escalation**. Skip this step and continue to
resolve the Attack. If the Total Power of your Attack
is **equal to or higher** than the AT value of the targeted BP card, you **wound** the Intruder and perform
**Escalation**.

## Performing Escalation

**If Escalation happens during a Spacer Attack, it
is resolved after the Intruder Responses step,
but before the Leave Spacer tokens and Suppression step.**

Escalation is the process of adding more powerful
cards to the BP and AI decks. It works slightly differently for each deck and in some special circumstances, but the general principle is the same. If you
are instructed to search a deck and discard pile for
a card, always prioritize cards from the deck. Only if
you find no applicable cards in the deck should you
search the discard pile.

For a full breakdown of each case, see the chart on
the next page.

## Escalating the BP Deck

Your attack has exposed a deeper or more important body part of the Intruder. Maybe you’ve broken
through the outer defenses, maybe you’ve punctured their spacesuit or smashed an exposed exoskeleton scale. Beneath lies something new, something more vital to the wellbeing of the creature.

In general, when the current BP card leaves the BP
deck to become a Wound, you take a random BP
card of a higher level from the BP Escalation deck
and shuffle it into the BP deck. If the new BP card
would end up as the **only card in the deck**, shuffle
in the BP discard pile too.

For special cases, see the full escalation chart on
the next page.

## Escalating the AI Deck

Just as your attack has exposed a more vital part of
the Intruder’s body, so has it exposed the creature
itself to the notion of death. It does not like this, and
will become more aggressive and deadly to assure
it does not fall today!

To escalate the AI deck, search the AI deck and discard pile (prioritizing the deck) for a card matching
the wounded BP card’s level and remove it from
the Battle. Then, take a random AI card of one level
higher and shuffle it into the AI deck. If there is now
only one card in the AI deck or you removed a card
from the discard pile, shuffle the discard pile into
the deck.

If there are no AI cards that match the level of the
BP card, remove a card of one level higher and escalate based on that card. This will lead you straight
from a level I card to level III. **Note:** If there are no
more current or higher-level cards to escalate, you
will add a permanent stat bonus instead.

For special cases, see the chart on the next page.

## Escalations Outside of Wounding

Some effects, like Responses, may instruct you to
escalate the Intruder even if there is no Wound, or
even outside of a Spacer Attack. If that happens,
simply perform the Escalation as normal, with the
following **exception**: as no Wound was dealt, you
will have to remove the lowest BP card from the Incursion.
