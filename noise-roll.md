# Noise Roll

The *Shepherd* is a derelict starship, dead and silent.
It’s so very easy for your Spacers to make noise.
And noise draws terrible things.

Whenever a Spacer makes Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg), for example
when they move hurriedly, **they have to make a
Noise Roll** with the appropriate number and color
of dice (usually the number of Blips on the board).
Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg) uses Danger dice ![White Danger Dice](svg/danger-dice-white.svg) / ![Red Danger Dice](svg/danger-dice-red.svg) / ![Black Danger Dice](svg/danger-dice-black.svg) (see the
[Dice](dice.md) box), which means you look out for Potentials ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg), not Successes ![Success Icon](svg/power-success.svg). Each die that doesn’t show
any ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg "Potential") is quiet. Good job! However, each die
showing at least one ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg "Potential") makes Noise. Noise can
trigger various effects, but the most common one
is Blip movement. **Whenever you make Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg),
you assigned the results to Blips, which will then
move towards you** (see [Blips](blips.md) and [Blip Movement](blip-movement.md)
below).

Noise Rolls are subjects to the following rules:

- Noise uses **Danger dice ![White Danger Dice](svg/danger-dice-white.svg)**.
- **Noise is usually depicted as an Intruder
  symbol ![Intruder Symbol](svg/intruder-symbol.svg).** This means you **roll as many
  dice as there are Blips** on the board. The
  **color** of the dice rolled **depends** on the current **Countdown level** and can’t be found on
  the Intruder Sheet. Generally, the longer the
  Extraction Run goes, the more alert the Intruders are and the more severe die you will roll.
- If there are more Blips on the board than
  there are dice of a given color, substitute the
  remaining dice with dice of a higher color
  tier (i.e. if there’s 5 Blips on the board and
  you have to roll red dice, take 4 red dice and
  add 1 black die). This is called **promotion**.
- If you have to promote dice and you’re already using all the black dice provided, trigger the **Overwhelm** Intruder effect for each
  dice missing (i.e. if there’s 5 Blips on the
  board and you have to roll black dice, roll 3
  black dice and trigger the Overwhelm effect
  twice).
- Some actions, and weapons, are so loud,
  that they always make Noise. Those effects
  show Noise as a number or modifier – they
  always make at least that much Noise. If
  Noise has a stiff bonus, i.e. “+1”, apply that
  bonus as that many ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg "Potential") results to a chosen die. This means such a Noise roll always
  results in Noise (unless mitigated).
- If the Noise source specifies the number and
  color of dice rolled, roll those dice instead.
  In other words, a specific dice configuration
  always overrides ![Intruder Symbol](svg/intruder-symbol.svg "Intruder") Noise.
- You may use Confidence ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg) tokens and
  Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) to re-roll Noise dice and Discipline ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg)
  tokens to mitigate Noise (see [Spacer Pool and Spacer Tokens](spacer-pool-and-spacer-tokens.md) on p. 8 for details).
- When you make Noise, you immediately
  take the **Priority Target/Last to Noise ![Priority Targer Icon](img/icon-target.png) marker**.
- Noise will trigger Blip movement (see [Blips](blips.md) and [Blip Movement](blip-movement.md) below).

**Remember:** Various game effects may check for
Noise and instruct you to perform a variety of tasks
and tests, but there is one effect that always triggers
after a Noise: Blip movement.
