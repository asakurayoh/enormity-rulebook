# Spacer Phase

In the **Spacer Phase**, each Spacer will get one turn,
during which they will **play up to 3 Action cards**
to perform various actions, like moving, attacking,
scouting or scavenging. They will also perform other free actions and use Spacer abilities, including
Stratagems. **Remember:** Spacers can take their
turns in any order they like!

The flow of a Spacer’s turn follows a very simple order:

**1. Clear Action cards:** Take the Actions cards
you’ve played during last turn back into your hand.

**2. Play Action cards:** Play Action cards **one at
a time**; this means that you play a card, resolve its
effects and only then proceed to playing another card.

**3. End your turn:** Once you play your 3 Action cards
(or choose not to play any more), you may end your
turn. Play then proceeds to another player.

A word of warning. Even though this is your time to
act, Blips will still move in response to Noise (see
Noise Roll on p. 16), and previously hidden Intruders may perform ambush attacks that break out a
Spacer’s turn. In **Enormity**, you are never safe.
