# Spacer Pool And Spacer Tokens

The Spacer Pool is the heart of the hard co-op me-
chanics of Enormity. You will use abilities to place
tokens into the Incoming Pool, and will use the to-
kens from the Active Pool to perform re-rolls, modify
your results and pay for various actions and effects.

When you place tokens, they end up in the Incoming
Pool. Unless stated otherwise, **you cannot use to-
kens from the Incoming Pool, only those in the
Active Pool**. At the end of your Spacer turn, all toÂ­
kens from the Active Pool are discarded, and all
tokens from the Incoming Pool are moved to the
Active Pool, becoming available to the player that
will take their turn.

There are 3 main types of Spacer tokens:

**Discipline ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg):** This token reflects your conduct under
duress. A single Discipline token allows you to
turn 1 Potential ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg) a **Spacer Attack**, **Skill Test**, **Scouting Check** or
**Noise Roll**.

**Confidence ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg):** This token reflects your morale and
poise. A single Confidence token allows you to re-roll
any single **Spacer Attack**, **Skill Test**, **Scouting
Check** or **Noise Roll** die **once**. **Note: You may later
try to re-roll that die with Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg)!**

**Expertise ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg):** This token allows you to **pay the cost
of many abilities**, **actions**, **environment interactions** and **Stratagems**. Additionally, when you are
tokens to lower received
attacked, you may use ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg "Expertise") tokens to lower received
damage, at a ratio of 1 token per 1 ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg "Vitals"), to a minimum of 1.

To sum up:

- You place Spacer tokens into the Incoming
Pool.
- You cannot use tokens from the Incoming
Pool.
- You may use tokens from the Active Pool.
- At the end of a Spacer turn, the Active Pool
is discarded and the Incoming Pool becomes
the new Active Pool.
- **You can only use 1 token of a given type
per die.**
