# 1. Intruders Activate

Activate each revealed Intruder on the board, starting with the one closest to a Spacer. If two or more
Intruders are equally close, players choose the order of their activations.

When a **baseline Intruder** activates, it establishes
a target (A), performs the first AI protocol from their
protocol array that applies (B), and then resolves
any additional actions, if applicable (C).

**Note that a Boss Intruder’s activation flows differently – see Boss Intruder Activation on p. 33.**
