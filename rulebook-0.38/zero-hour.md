# Zero Hour

When the Countdown goes to the ‘0’ space – called
the zero hour – things are going to heat up quickly.
Remember, it’s not the end of the game, the Countdown Track is not a timer, but it may very well be
the end of you!

The **Adversary** arrives.

## Adversary

The Adversary is one of the Boss Intruders you may
face during Incursions. During an Extraction Run,
you won’t be using their normal game components,
though, just their Adversary card: an overpowered,
unstoppable monstrosity.

When the Countdown marker reaches space 0 ![](svg/icon-zero-hour.svg),
immediately spawn the Adversary from the track.
If there is no Adversary on the track, draw one from
the Adversary Deck. Take their Adversary card and
place it near the board.

The Adversary card specifies exactly where to
spawn them, if not, spawn them adjacent to Last
to Noise Spacer. During the Intruder Phase, an Adversary behaves like any other Intruder, with the
following exceptions:

- It always activates first.
- It can end its movement on another Intruder; if it does, displace that other Intruder to
  the closest empty space.
- Unlike the Boss counterpart, an Adversary
  has a Speed value.
- Though the Adversary has AT, it’s Wound
  value is ![Infinity Symbol](svg/wound-infinity.svg "Infinity"); this means that although you
  can hurt it – and slow it down – you can never kill an Adversary. Or can you?

**Demo note:** You won’t find Mothman’s Adversary
card in the demo… but we have printed it in the
Mythos book, on p. 7! If you want, you can play with
him – just note it’s going to ramp up the endgame
difficulty!
