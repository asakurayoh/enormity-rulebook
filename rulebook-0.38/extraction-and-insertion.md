# Extraction And Insertion

One man’s exit is another man’s entrance. Each Extraction Point you discover during your runs will become a new starting point for future runs, creating
a network of fast travel starting points, accessible
via an intraship tram system.

When you revisit a Location, you will start from that
Location’s Extraction Point which, for the purposes
of Spacer setup, will be called an Insertion Point. In
such a case, setup your Spacers adjacent to that
Insertion Point, or adjacent to other Spacers. This
allows for some flexibility in Spacer setup on a return visit.

There is one more important rule to keep in mind
when entering a Location through an Insertion
Point. **For this run, it stops being an Extraction
Point and is unavailable for Extraction. In other
words, you cannot get out the same way you
came in!** As there is at most one Extraction Point
per Location map page, you will always have to
move to at least one more Location page to find a
usable Extraction Point.
