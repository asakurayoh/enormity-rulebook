# Catching Breath

There’s only one way to discard an Exert card (and
only one at a time!) – by performing the **Catch
Breath** action. This is a special action whose effect
you resolve at the end of your turn. This action
also lowers your Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) by 1, limiting your
Rubicon bonuses. **Important: You cannot Catch
Breath during the same turn you exert!**
