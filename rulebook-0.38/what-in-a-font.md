# What's In A Font?

We use a plain, readable font for our
mechanical texts, but you may have
noticed the rather bold choice of the
![Header Font Example](img/header-font.png). It’s stylish, but less functional… or is it? It actually serves a vital
function: much like *italics*, if you don’t
focus on it, it will help your brain filter
non-essential texts, like names, flavor
text and traits, during gameplay, so
you are not overwhelmed with information.
