# Boss Intruders

Each Boss Intruder is represented by an oversized
Intruder Sheet that includes all the basic information about a given being. You will find a general
description of an [Intruder Sheet](anatomy-of-an-intruder.md) on p. 26 in the Intruder Phase section – here we’ll focus on new and
unique Boss components, like the AI and BP decks,
Traits, Signature Moves and Routines.
