# Open World Discoveries In The Full Game

In this Demo, each section has a limited amount of Discoveries, while the full game will
sport nearly 1000 of them. Discoveries will be tied to a campaign or persistent world (if you
decide to run your one-off sessions in one!) and reset after you finish that campaign or retire
a world.

In the full game, Discoveries will be grouped in sets. Whenever a set of Discoveries becomes
fully marked (or the only unmarked discoveries are those you have not fulfilled special conditions for), mark the special top space of that set. From now on, that set becomes **wild**: if you
ever make a Discovery from such a set, you will roll to see which one you got!

In the demo, once you run out of Discoveries from a given section, that’s it! Sorry, the demo
needs to end somewhere…
