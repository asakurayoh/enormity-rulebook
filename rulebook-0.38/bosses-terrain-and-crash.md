# Bosses, Terrain And Crash

Boss Intruders are impossibly strong. During movement, a Boss Intruder ignores Terrain
tiles, unless they have the Destructible keyword, in which case they are destroyed and removed from the board. Consequently, an Intruder can freely move through and onto spaces
with most Terrain tiles (including Obstacles). A Boss Intruder cannot move through walls
(black lines)â€¦ unless stated otherwise.

Most Boss Intruders have the Crash keyword. Spacers do not impede their movements in
any way, but a Spacer on a space the Boss Intruder moved through or onto suffers Crash: a
Spacer subjected to Crash loses -1 ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg "Vitals") and suffers Knockdown.

If the Boss Intruder ends its movement on a space occupied by a Spacer, that Spacer suffers **Crash and Unavoidable Knockback X**. Unavoidable Knockback happens in a straight
line away from the Intruder and is subject to all normal Knockback rules (see [Knockback](other-rules.md#knockback) on
p. 38) with the following exception: it cannot be lowered or ignored in any way other than
effects that cause you to stop (such as colliding with an Obstacle). If there are two equally
possible Unavoidable Knockback directions, the player chooses one.
