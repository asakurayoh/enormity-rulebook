# Flash Attacks

Sometimes the enemy comes out of nowhere.
Flash Attacks are a special type of Intruder Attack,
usually performed by an Intruder **that is not on the
board**. That’s right – it’s the ultimate surprise attack!

A Flash Attack will refer to one of the Intruders –
usually a Boss Intruder – by name. When this happens, take that Intruder’s miniature and, unless
stated otherwise, place it on the board, adjacent
to the Flash Attack’s target. Then, draw a single AI
card from the indicated AI Deck. The Intruder performs that card against the target (ignoring original
targeting instructions and restrictions).

After you resolve the Flash Attack, remove the Intruder’s miniature from the board. It vanishes into
the void it came from. Note, sometimes the Flash
Attack will direct you to place the Intruder’s miniature on the Zero Hour ![Zero Hour Icon](svg/icon-zero-hour.svg) space of the Countdown
Track. In that case, the Intruder becomes your current Adversary ([see above](zero-hour.md#adversary)).
