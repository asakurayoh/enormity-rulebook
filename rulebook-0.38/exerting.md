# Exerting

Sometimes the situation will become really desperate
and you will need to push yourself beyond your limits
to succeeds. Sometimes, three actions won’t be
enough. That is when you will want to **exert**.

Once per turn, you may exert. To exert, after performing an action from an Action card, gain +2 ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg "Stress")
and place an Exert card in your play area to flip that
Action card and immediately resolve any action on it.

An Exert card in your play area acts as a played
Action card, but one you don’t remove at the start
of your turn. From the moment its played, it is considered to be your first Action card played each
turn, limiting you to playing 2 other cards per turn.

You may exert even if you already have an Exert card
in your play area, but if you ever take your third Exert
card, after resolving any extra action, you die.
