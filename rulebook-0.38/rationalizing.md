# Rationalizing

Rationalizing is an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action you can
perform to keep your nerves in check and push
through to extraction. **RATIONALIZE** is one of the
simpler actions you can take, as it simply lowers
your Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) by 2. As Stress is used for re-rolls
and having more than 9 Stress results in death
(See [Death and Life Spares](other-rules.md#death-and-life-spares) on p. 42), you want
to keep it low.

**Note:** As an Adrenaline action, Rationalizing raises
your Adrenaline and allows you to leave Spacer tokens!

***Full Game:** In the full game, Rationalizing will have
additional uses.*
