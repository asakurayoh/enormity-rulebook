# Incursions

Incursions are climatic battles with especially powerful Intruders, called a Boss Intruders. They take
place in specially designed locations, called **lairs**,
and introduce special AI and BP decks, and the Escalation mechanic.

Generally, Extraction Runs and Incursions follow
the same rules, with only a few notable exceptions.
These exceptions will be presented below.
