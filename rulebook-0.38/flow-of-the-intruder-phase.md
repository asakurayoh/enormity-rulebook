# Flow Of The Intruder Phase

During an Extraction Run, the Intruder Phase observes the following order:

1. **Intruders activate:** Each Intruder acts according
to their AI protocols or AI cards.
2. **Blip Patrols:** Blips move in their predetermined
directions or, on higher Countdown levels, converge
on the Spacers.
3. **End of Round:** End of Round effects happen.
Important: The Intruder Phase during an Incursion
flows slightly differently; [see p. 32](incursions.md) for details.
