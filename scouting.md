# Scouting

Scouting is an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action that allows you
to stay on top of the Intruders, as it allows you to
proactively check out a Blip signal and verify if it is
a glitch or if maybe something terrible is coming
your way – and say hello with your firearms.

Each Suit is equipped with a default Light source ![Light Source Icon](svg/icon-light-source.svg), 
which may be upgraded by a variety of means
later during the game. Each Light source has a **field**,
which follows the rules for Weapon range ![Weapon Range Icon](svg/icon-range.svg) (see
Effective Range on p. 21), and **intensity**, measured
in Power dice. The basic suit has an intensity of ![White Power Dice](svg/power-dice-white.svg "White Power Dice").

**You can only scout Blips that are within your
Light field.** If there is an eligible Blip within range,
you may perform the Scout action against it. When
you do, you perform a Scout Roll - roll as many Light
**dice** as shown on your Light source:

- If you roll at least 1 Power ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg), you may reveal
  the Blip. If it’s an Echo ![](svg/black.svg), discard it and
  spawn a new Blip, according to normal
  spawning rules.
- If it’s an Intruder , you may flip it back or immediately spawn the Intruder on an eligible
  space. Then, *if you want*, you may flip the
  Brainstorm card and immediately perform an
  Attack against one of the newly spawned Intruders, using an equipped Weapon. You do
  not gain a second Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) boost, but
  you do leave Spacer tokens. This free attack
  does not Exert you (see [Exerting](exerting.md) on p. 14).
- If you don’t roll any Power, you failed
  to scout the Blip.
- You may use Confidence ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg) tokens and
  Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) to re-roll your dice, and Discipline ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg)
  tokens to turn Potentials ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg) into (see
  [Spacer Pool and Spacer tokens](spacer-pool-and-spacer-tokens.md) on p. 8 for details)

**Note:** As an Adrenaline action, Scouting raises your
  Adrenaline and allows you to leave Spacer tokens!
