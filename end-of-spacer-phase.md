# End Of Spacer Phase

Sometimes a game effect will trigger at the end of
the Spacer Phase. In such a case, itâ€™s resolved after
all of the Spacers take their turns, but before they
proceed to the Intruder Phase. If there is more than
one End of Phase effect, players resolve these in
any order they like.
