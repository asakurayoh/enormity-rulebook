# Other Rules

## Conditions

Various effects (like Discoveries and Intruder actions) will cause Spacers to gain Condition cards that apply additional negative or
positive effects. When you gain a Condition
card, place it next to your Spacer Board. Some
Conditions may also require you to gain **Condition
tokens**. These are always placed on the corresponding Condition card, or, in the case of Radiation, directly on your Spacer Board. All Conditions
are discarded after the end of an Extraction Run or
Incursion.

*Condition card, Condition token and Radiation token*

Some Conditions may have additional **Lingering:**
effects that trigger if you were unable to get rid of
them before the session ended. If you gain a Condition card outside of a Run or Incursion, it remains
active until the end of the next Run or Incursion.

Some cards instruct you to gain a certain Condition, while others become Conditions themselves.
You cannot gain a Condition if you already have it,
but some Conditions may trigger additional effects
if you would gain them again.

## Stress Breakdowns

Space travel gets to you. The dark, the cold, the isolation. The void. In these conditions even the most
stalwart of souls begins to buckle. So, when the
Intruders show up, your mind is ready to give up.

The first time your Vitals ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) and Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) indicators meet or pass each other during a Run, you will
suffer a Stress Breakdown. Immediately draw a random Stress Breakdown card and resolve its effect.

There is a silver lining here. If you manage to survive
your breakdown, you will come out stronger for it.
First, you won’t have to draw another Stress Breakdown for the entirety of the Run or Incursion.

Secondly, you flip your Stress Breakdown card, to
enable its bonus or ability. From now on, until the
end of the Run or Incursion, you possess that ability.

## Skill Tests

During your Runs, you will be often asked to perform a **Skill test**. These are generally associated
with a specific Skill (like Intelligence ![Intelligence Icon](svg/icon-intelligence.svg) or Strength ![Strength Icon](svg/icon-strength.svg)
). Note that each Spacer has at least 1 point in
every Skill.

To perform a Skill test, simply roll as many ![White Power Dice Icon](svg/power-dice-white.svg "Power") dice
as your bonus to the appropriate skill and compare
the result to the difficulty of the test, expressed as
a target number called the Aptitude Threshold ![Antinomy Threshold Icon](svg/icon-antinomy-threshold.svg) - AT for short, and simplicity.

Skill tests can be re-rolled using ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg "Confidence") and ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg "Stress"), just like
Attacks, and ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg "Discipline") can be used to turn ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg "Potential") into ![Power Symbol](svg/power-success.svg "Power Symbol").

Some tests require you to achieve or beat a certain
AT, while others measure the degree of your success (I.e. the more successes ![Power Symbol](svg/power-success.svg "Power Symbol") you get, the better).
Each Skill test you will be presented with will precisely tell you what is considered a success, and
what a failure.

## Abilities

Spacer cards, Suit cards, equipped Gear cards, as
well as other game elements, give you access to
various abilities. Some of them can be used as free
actions or as **reactions**, others will have a specific
timing condition or even grant a constant effect.

In general, each effect described within the **ability
box** of a card is an ability. The most common abilities are called keywords, and will be discussed on
p. 38. Unless stated otherwise, abilities are not actions.

## Passive Abilities

Abilities that **do not** require you to pay a cost or
fulfill any condition are called **passives**. **Passives**
are constantly interacting with the game as long as
they are in play. Most passives continuously seek
specific timing conditions and **must be resolved**
anytime the specified condition is met, unless the
ability text itself specifically says that “**you may**”
resolve its effect.

As a general rule, you must always resolve keywords that place Spacer tokens in the Spacer Pool
(like Discipline X), as well as keywords that hinder
you in any way (like Heavy). You generally **may** use
abilities that grant you move-like abilities (like Fallback X). See the Keywords List on p. 38 to learn
more about using other keyword abilities.

As long as their conditions are fulfilled, passives
**can be used multiple times during the same
Round**.

## Triggered Abilities

These abilities require the Spacer to consciously
make a decision to use them. **As a result, unless
stated otherwise, you may only use them once
per Round.**

If the ability has one or more prerequisites (costs
and/or conditions), these are listed before the ability’s name or within its text. A player must always
meet the prerequisites of a triggered ability in order
to trigger that ability.

## Reactions

Reactions are a type of triggered ability denoted by
the reaction ![Window Of Opportunity Symbol](svg/icon-window-opportunity.svg "Window Of Opportunity") symbol. Reactions are powerful
effects that may be performed during a **window of
opportunity** (see p. 29). As windows of opportunity
are generally found on AI cards, **Reactions allow
Spacers to act out of turn, during the Intruder
Phase**!

Whenever you encounter the ![Window Of Opportunity Symbol](svg/icon-window-opportunity.svg "Window Of Opportunity") symbol preceding an instruction, you may activate abilities immediately **before** you resolve that instruction. During a
single ![Window Of Opportunity Symbol](svg/icon-window-opportunity.svg "Window Of Opportunity") each Spacer may activate any number
of abilities in any order, but no more than one ability
with the same name per Spacer.

## Ability Costs And Free Abilities

In **Enormity**, anything can be an ability cost. Common costs include:

- Spacer tokens, like ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg "Expertise"), ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg "Confidence") and ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg "Discipline")
- Actions or Action cards
- Gaining Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg)
- Exhausting a game element
- Discarding a game element
- Discarding an Ammo ![Ammo Icon](svg/icon-ammo.svg) or charge ![Charge Token icon](svg/used-charges.svg) tokens.

Other, more specific costs may be listed in the particular ability.

Paying ability costs for usage is **always voluntary**
(you **may** pay the cost to resolve the ability). As
such, **these costs can never be prevented or ignored** by the use of other game effects.

Abilities that do not have a cost are called **free**.

You cannot activate an ability if you cannot pay its
full cost (e.g. an ability requires you to raise and
your ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg "Stress") and it’s already at 9, or an ability requires
you to discard a charge and there are none remaining).

## Keywords

A keyword is an ability which conveys specific,
common rules. Each keyword has its own rules
which can be found on the keyword list below.
These are all **named abilities** and follow all of the
rules and restrictions of named abilities.

Some abilities are followed by a number, or X. Unless the ability text says otherwise, every such keyword is **stackable**. This means you may activate
several stackable keyword abilities with the same
name at the same time. Their effects then add up
and “stack.” For example, two separate Discipline 1
abilities would effectively be the same as Discipline 2.

## Keywords List

The following list of **Enormity** keywords is hardly
exhaustive, but covers all abilities presented in this
demo.

**Advance X:** When declaring an Attack with this
weapon, move up to X space towards the target.

**Burst:** This weapon can affect more than one target
with a single Attack. See p. 22 for details.

**Confidence X:** During the **Leave Spacer tokens
and Suppression step** of a Spacer Attack, place X
Confidence tokens into the Incoming Spacer Pool.
A single Confidence token allows you to re-roll any
single **Spacer Attack**, **Skill Test**, **Scouting Check**
or **Noise Roll** die **once**. **Note: You may later try to
re-roll that die with Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg)!**

**Cover:** Terrain keyword. The target gains cover
from a ranged attack (like ‘Shoot’) if it is **adjacent**
to a Cover Terrain tile, and the tile is **between** it and
the Attacker. A tile is considered to be between two
figures if it is possible to draw an imaginary line
through the middle of a column or a row so that the
two figures are on opposite sides of that line. None
of the figures can occupy a space in either that column or row. Cover allows you to **lower the tier of
one of the Power dice of the Attack** (from ![Black Power Die](svg/power-dice-black.svg "Black Power Die") to ![Red Power Die](svg/power-dice-red.svg "Red Power Die")
or ![Red Power Die](svg/power-dice-red.svg "Red Power Die") to ![White Power Die](svg/power-dice-white.svg "White Power Die")).

![](img/cover-example.png)  
*In the first example (1), the Spacer is in cover. They are adjacent
to the Terrain tile with the Cover keyword (as shown by the orange
box), and are on opposite sides of Terrain tile (as shown by the red
line drawn through the Terrain tile’s space). In the second example
(2), the Spacer is not in cover: they are not adjacent to a Terrain tile
with the Cover keyword. In the third example (3), the Spacer is also
not in cover in relation to either Intruder. Although they are adjacent
to a Terrain tile with the cover keyword, they are it is not between
them (i.e they are not on opposite sides of the red line).*

**Crash:** This is an Intruder keyword. A Spacer subjected to Crash loses -1 ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg "Vitals") and suffers Knockdown.
A Spacer suffers Crash each time an Intruder with
the keyword moves onto or
through their space, as well as when any effect
forces it to move onto a space with an Obstacle Terrain tile or places an Obstacle Terrain tile on theirs.

**Dazed:** Take a Dazed Condition Card.

**Destructible:** When a Spacer or **Intruder** is involuntarily moved onto this tile, or when a Boss Intruder moves through this tile, **or this tile is used for
Cover**, it is destroyed. **Note:** If a Spacer or baseline
Intruder is knocked back, they ignore non-Obstacle
Terrain tiles they move through. Therefore, they will
not destroy a Destructible tile unless they end their
movement on it.

**Discipline X:** During the **Leave Spacer tokens
and Suppression step** of a Spacer Attack, place X
Discipline tokens into the Incoming Spacer Pool. A
single Discipline token allows you to turn 1 Potential ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg)
into a Success/Power ![Power Symbol](svg/power-success.svg) during a **Spacer Attacks**, **Skill Test**, **Scouting Check** or **Noise Roll**.

**Devastating:** If you roll a Crit Quadrant on a die, you
may roll an additional die of that color.

**Discharge:** During the Raise Adrenaline and Depleting Weapon Step place a Discharge Status ![Status Icon](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg) on
it. Discard this token at the start of your next turn.
Reload and Fast Reload actions **will not remove** a
Discharge Status ![Status Icon](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg) token.

**Displace:** Move the displaced target to an empty
space adjacent to its current position. If a Spacer is
displaced and there is no space it can be legally displaced to, they die instead.

**Empty Clip:** When depleting Ammo during an Attack, deplete all Ammo to gain +1 ![Power Symbol](svg/power-success.svg "Sucess/Power").

**Expertise ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg):** During the **Leave Spacer tokens and
Suppression step** of a Spacer Attack, place X Expertise tokens into the Incoming Spacer Pool. This
token allows you to **pay the cost of many abilities**,
**actions**, **environment interactions** and **Stratagems**. Additionally, when you are attacked, you
may use ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg "Expertise") tokens to lower received damage, at a
ratio of 1 token per 1 ![Vital Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg "Vitals"), to a minimum of 1.

**Fallback X:** After resolving a Spacer Attack, but
before any Reprisal or Follow-up Attacks, you may
move X spaces away from the target of the Attack.

**Heavy:** This weapon can only be reloaded with a Full
Reload action.

**Indestructible:** Terrain keyword. This Terrain tile
cannot be destroyed in any way. It invalidates Terrain placement on top of it.

**Knockback X:** [See box](knockback.md).

**Knockdown:** Gain the *Knockdown* Condition card,
*Falling down* side up, and place your miniature on
its side. Follow the rules of the Condition card. If
Knockdown is caused by an Attack, it affects the
Target only if it is within the Intruder’s effective
range (adjacent for Melee Attacks, in the designated zone for Zone Attacks, within X spaces for
Ranged X Attacks, etc.). If it’s caused by a Response, it affects the Attacker only if they are within adjacency.

**Lethal:** During intruder attack, treat all ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg "Potential")
as ![Power Symbol](svg/power-success.svg "Success/Power").

**Light ![White Danger Die](svg/danger-dice-white.svg)/![Red Danger Die](svg/danger-dice-red.svg)/![Black Danger Die](svg/danger-dice-black.svg):** Changes your Light source’s die
type to ![White Danger Die](svg/danger-dice-white.svg "White Danger Die")/![Red Danger Die](svg/danger-dice-red.svg "Red Danger Die")/![Black Danger Die](svg/danger-dice-black.svg "Black Danger Die").

**Linear:** Some ranged weapons require simple trajectories that limit their flexibility. If a weapon has
the Linear keyword, it can only shoot in straight
lines.

**Lure X:** Intruder keyword. Move the target of the
keyword X spaces towards the source of the keyword.

**Noiseless:** This weapon does not generate Noise
Rolls when used.

**Obscuring:** Terrain keyword. This tile blocks Line of
Sight.

**Obstacle:** Terrain keyword. Spacers and baseline
Intruders cannot move through Obstacles. Many
move-like abilities interact with Obstacles.

**Pushback X:** Turn the source towards the affected
miniature. Then, move X spaces in the direction of
the affected miniature, pushing it in a straight line.

**Radiate X:** If your target has not been killed, during
the **Leave Spacer tokens and Suppression step** of
a Spacer Attack, place X Radiation tokens on their
Intruder Sheet. During the draw BP card step of a
Spacer Attack, if the total number of Radiation tokens on the sheet equals the card’s AT, immediately
deal it as a Wound, suffering all responses, discard
all Radiation tokens, draw another BP card and continue the Attack (if able).

**Radiation X:** Intruder keyword. The Spacer gains X
Radiation tokens. When a Spacer gains their 5th Radiation token, they die.

**Reach:** The weapon is considered a Reach weapon.
If a weapon has the Reach keyword, it means it’s
actually not a ranged weapon, but a particularly
long Melee Weapon. You still count the distance
just like you would for range, but are not considered
using a ranged weapon for other game purposes.
The attack is considered a melee attack.

**Reflex:** Move up to 1 space.

**Warn:** Move another Spacer up to 1 space.
