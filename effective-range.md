# Effective Range

In Enormity, most weapons are **ranged**, meaning you can attack with them from a distance. The Range ![Range Icon](svg/icon-range.svg) weapon statistic shows the exact
distance you can shoot at, measured in spaces. You count the distance just like you would count spaces for movement purposes, in other words,
range is also measured cardinally, and **never diagonally**.

If the range symbol is **crossed out ![Range Icon Crossed Out](svg/icon-range-crossed.svg)**, the weapon is considered a **Melee weapon** and requires the Spacer to be adjacent to its target (see the
[Board Spaces, Adjacency, Lines, Intersections and Out-of-Bounds Spaces](board-spaces-adjacency-lines-intersections-and-out-of-bounds-spaces.md) box on p. 15).

Some ranged weapons require simple trajectories that limit their flexibility. If a weapon has the **Linear** keyword, it can be shot only **in straight lines**.

If a weapon has the **Reach** keyword, it means itâ€™s actually not a ranged weapon, but a particularly long Melee Weapon. You still count the distance
just like you would for range, but are not considered to be using a ranged weapon for other game purposes. This attack is considered a melee attack.

Finally, if the weapon has the **Deadzone** keyword, it means it cannot be used on an adjacent target.
