# Cardinal Rules

## Golden Rule

If there is ever a conflict between rules, the specific rules on cards precede the general rules of the Rulebooks.

## Harsh Space Rule

If thereâ€™s still a conflict, two rules seem equivalent or there is no clear way to discern precedence, or there is ever any ambiguity as to how a rule
is supposed to be interpreted, you go with the outcome that is **the worst** for the players.

## Flashback Rule

As long as you have not rolled dice, drawn cards or done any other step to randomize the game, you can undo your last moves as you like (take
a different movement action, place different Spacer tokens into the pool etc.). The limit to which you can undo your moves is your memory.
