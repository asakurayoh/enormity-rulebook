# A. Establishing Target

When activating a baseline Intruder, first check
their **Target** box â€“ this indicates the Spacer that will
become the **target** or focus point of their action.
Usually, this will be the closest Spacer to the Intruder (see the [Distance](distance.md) box on p. 27).

**Remember, an Intruder needs LoS to the Target
only if the protocol requirement or AI card command line requires it to be in front or in sight.
Most baseline Intruders do not need LoS to
activate!**
