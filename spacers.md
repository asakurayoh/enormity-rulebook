# Spacers

In **Enormity**, you play as Spacers, astronauts
stranded on the massive starship *the Shepherd*.
During a run, your Spacer is represented by a combination of a Character card and a Suit card, joined
by the rubicon connector into a player board. You
may have noticed the back of the Character card
has an intriguing graph on it. In the full game, this
graph will be used to develop your Spacer (see Character Progression on p. 43).

The **Dark Side of the Sun Demo** includes 5 pre-generated named characters— the crew of the NASF
*Coventry*— while the full game will include additional
rules and components to create fully custom characters, for unlimited replayability.

Besides their name and **Action cards**, which you
will find listed on the backs (see Action Cards on p. 11), 
a Spacer is defined by a set of **attributes** and
**statistics**. Those on the Character card are intrinsic
to your character, while the rest depends on your
current Suit card.
