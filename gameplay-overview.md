# Gameplay Overview

You play as **Spacers**, astronauts stranded on *the
Shepherd*. To survive, gain resources and information,
you go on **extraction runs**, dungeon crawls that
lead you deeper and deeper into the mysterious
ship, and maybe even beyond. You choose where
to go and what terrors to face, slowly expanding
your inter-connected location map. You move
from area to area, fighting or avoiding Intruders,
scavenging, exploring. The longer you stay, the
more dangerous it becomes. At some point – one
chosen by you! – you’ll have to extract through an
Extraction Point or risk losing everything you’ve
worked towards!

At several points in the game, an existential threat
will appear, and you will have to deal with an **incursion**,
a battle against a terrible boss Intruder. Extraction
run enemies may appear during boss battles, and
bosses may invade your regular extractions –
especially if you reach the zero hour!

After each extraction and incursion, you will travel
to a safe location, where you may craft gear, develop
your character and research alien technologies.
**This will still happen in a physical location on the
map, you are never taken out of the survival experience!** 
**Note:** For brevity’s sake, this part of the
gameplay has been mostly automated in the demo.
