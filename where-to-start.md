# Where To Start

Your first **Dark Side of the Sun** session will be a
guided extraction, so we’ll start with the rules for
Extraction runs. Note that extraction runs and in-
cursions share the majority of their rules. Thus, the
incursion rules section will only highlight new rules
or major differences. At the end of the rules section,
you’ll find ‘Other Rules’, a collection of additional
mechanics and smaller rules that didn’t neatly fit
into either of the former sections.
