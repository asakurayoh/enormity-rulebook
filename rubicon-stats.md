# Rubicon Stats

These three statistics represent your Spacer’s
physical and mental wellbeing, as well as combat readiness, as measured by your EVA suit’s
internal monitor

Unlike typical stats, these three are in flux.
(1) Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) and (2) Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) will go up
as a result of attacking, using abilities, making
re-rolls and being exposed to intense fear, while
(3) Vitals ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) will go down as the result of getting
physically hurt. You will track rubicon stats
with plastic stackable (4) Rubicon indicators.

Rubicon stats usually operate on a scale of 0
to 9. Gaining or losing Rubicon stats over or
under these values will have dire consequences!
Thankfully, these stats will reset after each run.

## Vitals

Vitals ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) represent your overall physical condition.

Your ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) will go down as a result of suffering
**damage** from Intruders, the environment or
other story-related sources.

If your ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) would ever go below 1, you suffer a
**flatline**. Draw a Flatline card and check it with
the Scanner. As a result of a Flatline, you may
die, perform a counter attack or even awaken
some unknown force inside you (see Flatlining
on p. 30).

Regaining ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) is difficult, but not impossible,
there are abilities and items in the game that
facilitate this.

The first time your Vitals ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) and Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) indicators meet or pass each other, you will suffer a Stress Breakdown (see Stress Breakdown on
p. 37).

## Stress

Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) represents your overall mental
condition.

The most important Stress rule is: **whenever
you roll dice, you may always gain +1 ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) to
re-roll any single die once**, even if that dice
was already re-rolled from another source.
**Remember this always, this is your ultimate
lifeline!**

Otherwise, you will gain ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) as a penalty from
various sources, or as a cost of high-risk actions.

The first time your Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) and Vitals ![Vitals Icon](svg/icon-vitals.svg) indicators meet or pass each other, you will suffer
a Stress Breakdown (see Stress Breakdown on
p. 37).

To lower Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg), you will be using the **Rationalize** action (see Actions on p. 14).

If your ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) would ever go above 9, you suffer
a **nervous breakdown** (see Dying on p. 29).

## Adrenaline

Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) represents your overall combat
readiness. You gain ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) by performing certain
actions, like attacking, scouting or rationalizing
(see Actions on p. 14).

If your ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) would ever go above 9, you suffer
a **heart attack** (see Dying on p.29).
