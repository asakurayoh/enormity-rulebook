# Action Card

Each Spacer has 3 **special double-sided sleeved Action cards**. These are constructed before
each Extraction Run or Incursion by stacking together and placing into a single card sleeve the 3
cards granted by your Character, and the 3 granted by your Suit.

You always stack a <strong class="yellow">Yellow Character</strong> card with a <strong class="yellow">Yellow Suit card</strong>. You always stack a <strong class="blue">Blue Character</strong> card with a <strong class="red">Red Suit card</stronng>. Yellow cards usually allow you to move and perform minor activities, Blue cards allow you to perform various specialized activities, while Red cards allow you to
attack.

Note that the <strong class="blue">Blue Character</strong> card allows you to perform a variety of non-combat actions.

**Important:** These pairs function as a single card, so you cannot use both sides of a given card
during the same turn (unless you Exert).

In the Dark Side of the Sun Demo, each player starts with the same Action cards. Stack
them in the following way:

- Stack<strong class="yellow">Steady Walk</strong> with **<strong class="yellow">Cautious Sneaking</strong>
- Stack <strong class="yellow">Hurried Walk</strong> with <strong class="yellow">Anxious Sneaking</strong>
- Stack <strong class="red">Desperate Measures</strong> with <strong class="blue">Stressful Brainstorm</strong>

***Note:** Action Cards should be stacked back-toback so that both of their abilities are visible.*
