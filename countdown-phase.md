# Countdown Phase

The **Countdown Phase** represents the growing
tension and mounting resistance to the Spacers’
expedition. The longer your run goes on, the harder
it will become, and the more Intruders will swarm
in to stop you. When the marker reaches the **zero
hour ![Zero Hour Icon](svg/icon-zero-hour.svg)** space, things will become dire, and a
special deadly Adversary boss Intruder may start
hunting you – you should try to extract before that
happens! (see Extraction on p. 24). Note that the
rules for Adversaries during Extraction Runs are
disabled for the demo, but they will be available **in
the full game**. Each and every boss in the game can
become an Adversary.

During the Countdown Phase, resolve the following
steps in order:

**1. Move the Countdown Marker one space down
the Countdown Track:** This has various in-game
effects, some of which you will soon resolve, while
others are persistent and influence the entire run
(see the Countdown Track box on p. 13 for a detailed
explanation). **Note: Skip this step during the first
round of the run!**

**2. Resolve Discoveries:** If there are any Discovery
tokens on the current track space, resolve them
now. If the Discovery token is faceup, resolve the
matching Discovery card from the deck. If it’s facedown, reveal it and resolve a normal Discovery (see
Discoveries on p. 23).

**3. Resolve Blip tokens and Intruders:** If there are
any Blip tokens or Intruders on the current track
space, resolve them now. To resolve a Blip token
from the track, reveal it. If it’s an Echo, discard it
and spawn a new one according to normal Blip
rules (see Blips on p. 16). If it’s Intruders, immediately spawn them adjacent to the **Last to Noise ![Target Icon](img/icon-target.png)
Spacer. Do not perform ambush attacks!** These
Intruders will act in the Intruder Phase.

**4. Resolve the Blip symbol from the track:** If there
is a Blip symbol on the track – you will find them
on its Eclipse (red) and Extraction (black) levels –
spawn a Blip according to normal Blip rules.

Once done, you may proceed to the Spacer Phase.
