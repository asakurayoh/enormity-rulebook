# Spacer Attacks

Attack is an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action used to attack
Intruders. To perform a Spacer Attack action,
resolve these steps, called the **attack sequence**,
in the following order:

1. Choose Weapon and Target
2. Raise **Adrenaline** and Depleting Weapon
3. Resolve the Attack Roll
4. Intruder Responses
5. Leave Spacer tokens and Suppress
6. Generate Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg)

## 1. Choosing Weapon And Target

Choose the **active weapon**, then choose an Intruder
as your **target**. You can only choose a target in that
weapon’s **effective range** (see [Effective Range](effective-range.md) on p.
21) and LoS (see [Line of Sight](line-of-sight.md) on p. 21).

To become an active weapon, the weapon has to
meet certain requirements:
- It needs to be **equipped**
- It **cannot be exhausted**
- If it has an** Ammo or Charge attribute**,
  there must be at least 1 Ammo or Charge
  token left
-  It cannot have a **Discharge Status** token

If you cannot choose a legal active weapon, there
are no Intruders in your effective range or you don’t
have LoS, you cannot perform an attack. Do not
resolve any further steps of the attack sequence.
If an Attack ends in this step, it does not cause a
Chain Break (see p. 29).

## 2. Raising Adrenaline And Depleting Weapon

Raise your **Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg)** value by 1. If your active
weapon has an **Ammo or Charge attribute**, discard
1 corresponding token from it (note: some keywords
and effects may force you to discard more than
1 Ammo/Charge token per attack). If your active
weapon has the **Discharge keyword**, place a Status ![Status Token](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg)
token on it.

## 3. Resolving The Attack Roll

Intruders are otherworldly beings that are hard to
wound and almost impossible to kill. To reflect this,
when attacking an Intruder or a Boss Intruder, you
won’t be dealing direct damage; instead, you will be
checking if the Total Power of your attack is equal
to or higher than the Intruder’s current **Antinomy
Threshold ![Antinomy Threshold Icon](svg/icon-antinomy-threshold.svg)** (AT for short). If it is, you will wound it,
if not, tough luck!

To perform the Attack Roll, follow these steps:

### A. Create the Power Pool

First, gather your Power Pool. The pool is comprised
of Power dice of various colors (white, red and black,
green and orange) and, sometimes, of raw **Power**
points ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg). The higher the number of dice in the pool,
the better your chances of wounding an Intruder.
Most of your Power dice will come from the active
weapon itself, but sometimes you will gain Power
bonuses from other sources, like your Rubicon,
equipped non-weapon Gear, other cards and other
applicable game effects.

### B. Roll the Dice

To perform the Attack Roll, simply take all the dice
in your Power Pool and roll them. Each ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg "Power") symbol
gives you one Power. Then, add all the raw ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg "Power") you
have, each of these is simply treated as another ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg "Power")
symbol. Finally, each two ![Half Power Icon](svg/half-power-success.svg "Half Power") give you another +1 ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg "Power").

### C. Power Re-rolls, Potentials and other Modifiers

Before you resolve the Attack Roll, you have the
chance to modify it to your advantage in a variety
of ways, using tokens from the Active Spacer Pool,
weapon modifiers and Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg).

First, you may re-roll dice using **Confidence tokens ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg)**
from the Active Pool or **![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg "Confidence") weapon modifiers**.
One ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg "Confidence") allows you to re-roll **exactly one die once**,
and you must declare all dice you wish to re-roll
with ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg "Confidence") before re-rolling any of them.

If you wish to re-roll dice, and you have no Confidence ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg), you may still use Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) as a substitute:

- Gain +1 ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg "Stress") for each die you want to re-roll
  in this way.
- Other than your overall Stress level, there
  is no limit on the number of dice you may
  re-roll using Stress.
- You perform Stress re-rolls after normal
  Confidence re-rolls.
- You may re-roll a die already re-rolled with
  Confidence.
-  Each die may be re-rolled with Stress exactly once.
-  **Going over 9 ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg "Stress") result in your Spacer’s
  death.**

Each ![Potential Icon](svg/icon-potential.svg "Potential") result on a die gives you one **potential**.
These do not provide you with any benefits by themselves, but they can be turned into ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg "Power") using various
effects. The most common of those effects are the
**Discipline tokens ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg)** from the Active Pool or
**![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg "Discipline") weapon modifiers**.

The third type of Spacer token, Expertise ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg) does
not have a direct use in an attack, but may pay for
many other abilities and effects that influence it.

### D. Check for Critical Chance

After you’re done with all the re-rolls, check if you
have gained a Critical Chance. To do it, you have to
have **a total of 4+ critical quadrans ![](svg/critical-full.svg)** between
your dice ![](svg/critical-white.svg) ![](svg/critical.svg) and weapon ![](svg/critical-partial.svg).

If you’ve managed to get 4+ critical quadrants, your
attack may result in a **critical wound**. However,
this will only happen if you managed to beat the AT
value. Hence, it’s called a **critical chance**.

### D. Compare Power and AT

After using all re-rolls, symbols and all other applicable abilities, sum up all ![Power Icon](svg/power-success.svg "Power"). This is the **Total Power**
of this Attack. Remember, to successfully wound
an Intruder, your Total Power must be **equal to or
higher** than the current **![Antinomy Threshold Icon](svg/icon-antinomy-threshold.svg) AT value**!

You will find the Intruder’s AT value on its sheet, in a
space corresponding to the current Countdown level
or, in the case of a Boss Intruder, directly on the BP
card (see Wounding Boss, Intruders and Wounds on
p. 34).

If your Total Power is equal to or higher than the Intruder’s AT value, you deal a **Wound**. If you gained a critical
chance, you deal a **critical wound** instead! Most **baseline** Intruders **die** after being wounded once, but Boss
Intruders will take much more punishment (see Incursions on p. 32). Some particularly powerful **baseline**
Intruders can have multiple Wounds, too; whenever
you wound a **baseline** Intruder with a **Wound stat ![Wound Stat Icon](svg/wound-stat.svg)**,
place a Wounded Status ![Status Token Icon](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg) token near their base to
reflect the Wound. As soon as the number of Wounds
is equal to or higher than the Intruder’s Wound stat,
they are killed.

If your Total Power is less than the ![Antinomy Threshold Icon](svg/icon-antinomy-threshold.svg) AT value, you **fail**
to wound. **Note:** Some game elements have additional
effects that trigger (or may activate) on a Wound or Fail.
Remember to always resolve all **“Wound:”** and **“Fail:”**
effects.

## 4. Intruder Responses

Intruders are powerful, otherworldly beings, and
they do not stand idly by when attacked! Almost
every Spacer Attack will garner some form of response. 

Most responses are resolved immediately
after the Attack Roll, with the exception of the
deadly Reprisal Attacks (performed by the Intruders) and devastating Follow-up Attacks (performed
by Spacers), both of which happen after the current
Spacer Attack is fully resolved.

The exact nature of an Intruder response depends
on the result of the Attack Roll:

- If you scored a Wound, you resolve the
  **Wound** response. **Note:** You resolve the
  Wound response even if the Intruder dies,
  which will usually be the case with the lesser aliens.
- If you scored a critical wound, resolve the
  **Critical** (and ignore all other responses).
- If you failed to wound the Intruder, you resolve the **Fail** response.
- Sometimes an Intruder will also have an
  **Instinct** response that you have to resolve
  regardless of the attack (and in addition to
  any other normal response; the only exception to this is a critical wound, which would
  make you ignore an Instinct).

If the response doesn’t involve any new attacks, resolve it during this step. If there are no appropriate
responses (for example, you failed to wound, but
the Intruder Profile doesn’t have a Fail response),
nothing happens. If multiple responses apply, resolve them in the order of your choosing. Unless
stated otherwise, a response should be resolved
regardless of the Spacer’s positioning (like adjacency).

### Reprisal and Follow-up Attack responses

When these come up, note what kind of attack you
are meant to resolve, then finish up the current attack sequence. **The new Attack will happen immediately after this one is completely resolved and
will not cause a Chain Break.**

**Note:** Unless stated otherwise, responses are resolved **by** the Intruder **against** the Spacer (e.g. to
resolve Wound: Pushback 4, the Intruder would
push the Spacer 4 spaces).

## 5. Leaving Spacer Tokens And Suppressing

Regardless of how you fared during the attack – if
you managed to wound or kill the Intruder or not –
you will still contribute to your team’s effort. This
support comes in the form of leaving Spacer tokens
and potentially suppressing an unharmed Intruder.

### Spacer tokens

First, you may activate all applicable abilities from
your **Rubicon**, like ![Discipline Icon](svg/icon-discipline.svg "Discipline"), ![Confidence Icon](svg/icon-confidence.svg "Confidence") and ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg "Expertise"), that are below
the Adrenaline indictor threshold, as well as any
Discipline X, Confidence X and Expertise X abilities
from your active weapon and any other equipped
non-weapon cards.** Only the attacking Spacer** activates these abilities. Unless stated otherwise, all
the tokens generated with these abilities land in the
**Incoming Spacer Pool** (see [Spacer Pool and Spacer tokens](spacer-pool-and-spacer-tokens.md) on p. 8).
Note: Some keywords, like Fallback X, may also
trigger at this time.

### Suppressing

Failing to wound an Intruder is a dire outcome and
may put you in grave danger. There is a silver lining,
though: your attack might not have penetrated the
**Antinomy Threshold ![Antinomy Threshold Icon](svg/icon-antinomy-threshold.svg)** field, but it did suppress it,
if only for a little while.

If your Attack doesn’t penetrate the Intruder’s **Antinomy Threshold** field (AT for short), i.e., doesn’t
result in a Wound, you will leave **Suppression tokens ![Suppression Icon](svg/icon-suppressing-power.svg)** up to the value of your weapon’s Suppressing Power ![Suppression Icon](svg/icon-suppressing-power.svg). Place those tokens near the Intruder’s base.

Suppression tokens have a variety of game effects.
**Until the Intruder’s next activation:**

- each Suppression token counts as -1 Speed
- each Suppression token counts as -1 AT
- a suppressed Intruder does not perform Attacks of Opportunity (see Attacks of Opportunity on p. 30)

**Important: Suppression tokens from different
Attacks do not stack. An Intruder is always Suppressed up to the highest Suppression value (i.e.,
if your weapon has Suppressing Power of 1, while
an Intruder already has 2 Suppression tokens, it
will not gain another token, as the previous suppression value was higher than yours).**

## 6. Generating Noise

You are almost done, almost through… there is still
one more grim duty you have to perform. Check if
anything else heard your life and death struggle,
and is about to drop in with a visit.

If your active weapon is not Noiseless [[NOISELESS]]
, it will generate some kind of Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg). You perform this roll just like any other Noise Roll, rolling
the indicated number of Danger dice. If your Noise
box shows an Intruder symbol ![Intruder symbol](svg/intruder-symbol.svg), check the Intruder Sheet and take the **die corresponding to
your current Countdown level**.

Sometimes the Noise box shows a Danger die followed by a slash and an Ammo symbol ![Ammo symbol](svg/icon-ammo.svg). This
means ‘per shot’ and is used by weapons capable of
burst fire (see below).

**Remember: Whenever you make Noise , Blips
move towards you. This means that your Attack
may result in a Blip reveal and an Ambush attack!**

## Burst Attacks

The longer an extraction run goes, the harder it
becomes, and there may be times when you become overwhelmed by the sheer number of Intruders rushing your way. Thankfully, some of the
high-powered automatic weapons at your disposal
may even the odds.

If a weapon has a Burst X frame [[BURST X]] , it may
be used to target more than one Intruder with a single attack action, up to X Intruders. A Burst Attack
is considered a normal attack, but is subject to the
following additional rules:

- **Choosing weapon and target:** You declare
  the Burst Attack during the ‘Choose Weapon and Target’ step; each target needs to
  be within your effective range and your active weapon needs to have at least 1 Ammo
  token per target; if you don’t have enough
  Ammo for each target, you cannot declare
  that target
- **Raising Adrenaline and Depleting Weapon:** During the ‘Raise Adrenaline and Deplete
  Weapon’ step, discard 1 Ammo token per
  target; you still **only gain +1 Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg)**
- **Resolving separate Attack Rolls:** You resolve a separate Attack roll for each target,
  in your chosen order; only once you fully resolve one Attack roll, do you proceed to the
  next one;
- **Single Spacer Pool and modifiers:** The
  Spacer tokens in the Active Pool and your
  weapon modifiers are not duplicated; you
  have to be careful and make do with what
  you have!
- **Separate Intruder responses:** You proceed
  to Intruder responses only after resolving all
  Attack rolls; resolve responses in the same
  order you have resolved Attack rolls; if a single response makes another response unattainable for any reason, ignore it;
- **Leaving tokens and Suppression:** You do
  not double the Spacer tokens you leave, but
  you do suppress each target (if eligible)
- **Generating Noise:** You generate Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg)
   once, but the Noise level accounts for each
  additional target [[/![Ammo Icon](svg/icon-ammo.svg)]] .
