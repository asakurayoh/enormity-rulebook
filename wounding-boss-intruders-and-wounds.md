# Wounding Boss Intruders, And Wounds

When a Spacer successfully wounds a baseline
Intruder, it’s usually it for them. Boss Intruders are
not so easily defeated. They have multiple Wounds,
usually 10 or more, and a deck of BP cards that represents their body parts.

When a Spacer attacks a Boss Intruder, they draw
the top BP card and try to match or beat its AT.
After the Attack Roll, they resolve the appropriate
responses, like Wound: or Fail:.

Successfully wounded BP cards **become Wounds**
and end up on the Wound Stack. A Boss Intruder is
killed only when there is the appropriate number of
Wounds in the Wound Stack.

However, not all Wounds are equal! Some attacks
are so devastating that they inflict multiple Wounds

instead! The most common source of these **Double
Wounds** are the BP III cards. Some game effects,
especially Critical Wounds, can also cause you to
deal **Additional Single Wounds**. The general rules
are as follows:

- If you wound a BP I or BP II card, place it
  faceup on top of the Wound Stack. This is a
  single Wound.
- If you wound a BP III card, place 2 Double
  Wound ![Status Icon](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg) tokens on top of the Wound
  Stack and **set the wounded BP III card
  aside**. It will return to the bottom of the
  deck after Escalation (see Escalation p. 35).
- If you **critically wound** a BP III card, you
  place it on top of the Wound Stack instead.
  Each BP III card on the Wound Stack counts
  as two Wounds (just like a Double Wound
  would).
- If an effect instructs you to deal an **additional Single Wound**, place a Single Wound ![Status Icon](svg/icon-suprise-status.svg)
  token on top of the Wound Stack, in addition to any other Wounds you’ve dealt.
