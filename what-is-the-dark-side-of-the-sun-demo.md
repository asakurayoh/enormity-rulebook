# What Is The Dark Side Of The Sun Demo?

The Dark Side of the Sun Demo is a small taste of **Enormity**, a sampler if you will. It includes most of the core mechanics, 
from combat to exploration, to stealth and adventuring. It will showcase the dungeon-crawling extraction runs and 
incursions (boss battles). A perfect run will clock you around 8 to 10 hours, though you still won’t see all the 
content in one go (yes, even our demos are enormous!). Once you finish the demo, you can return to the game, to try 
out some other gear and ability combinations, and different Spacer team-ups, experience different encounters and look for more secrets.

The Demo is still a work in progress prototype and
should be treated as such. Specifically, this extends to

## Production Quality
The number and quality of components is not final.
The full game will include hundreds more cards,
dozens of different Intruders (including rank-and-file
ones, unique specimen and boss-type creatures,
like the Slendersuit), dozens of interconnected
Location maps, more tiles, hundreds of new Gear,
hundreds of Discoveries and more. Simply put,
there will be much more of everything.

The cardstock and cardboard will be thicker, and
the paper content (all the books) will be produced
in a different process, will be thicker, and printed
on higher quality paper in full color with an upgraded layout.

Finally, miniatures will be produced in plastic.

## Editing

This book and all Enormity game components have
been internally spellchecked and edited, but were
not independently edited, which is part of our quality
control for a final game product. Final editing will
take place once all the content of the game is locked in.
As such, there may be some spelling errors etc.
Those will be corrected before production.

## Difficulty

The difficulty of the Demo has been set at a certain
level. The final game will offer options to adjust the
difficulty (see the **In the Full Game** section at the
back of the Rulebook for more details). If you’re up
for a challenge, try the veteran Mothman Battle
(10 Wounds).

## Balance

The balance of the game, including Spacer and Suit
stats, Gear stats and Intruder attacks, is very much
a work in progress. Item discovery rates and crafting
costs are simplified or automated, as the limited
scope of the demo makes it challenging to showcase their full potential.

## Unavailable Features

The demo showcases the main features and
strengths of the game, the narrative, the Inverted
Combat ParadigmTM 3.0, the Action card system,
the Extraction gameplay, the mixture of firefights
and stealth, the robust AI mechanics, the co-op
actions, Intruder Escalation, exploration, looting
and luck mitigation.

However, there is still more that Enormity has
to offer. We’ll highlight those features at the
end of the Rulebook.
