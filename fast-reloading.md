# Fast Reloading

If you can’t spare the time for a full reload, there are
other ways to load that ammo – just not all of it! The
Fast Reload action allows you to reload a currently
equipped Weapon with **exactly 1 ammo ![Ammo Icon](svg/icon-ammo.svg)**.

- Some Weapons (with the **Heavy** keyword)
  can only be reloaded by the Full Reload action.
- You may fast reload a weapon even if it still
  has some Ammo tokens.
- Most Fast Reload actions demand you pay
  some additional cost, like ![Expertise Icon](svg/icon-expertise.svg "Expertise") or ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg "Stress"); if you
  cannot pay the cost, you cannot perform
  the action.
- A Fast Reload action **will not restore** used
  Charges ![Used Charge Icon](svg/used-charges.svg) **or remove** a Discharge Status.
