# Intruder Phase

In the **Intruder Phase**, the alien and unknowable
comes for your Spacers. Blips patrol the map or
converge on the Spacers, while revealed Intruders
act. Intruders are not controlled by a specific player.
Instead, their behaviors will be dictated by AI protocols, and AI and BP cards.

## Intruders

Intruders are all sorts of extraterrestrial – or extradimensional? Or… — beings you can encounter on *the
Shepherd*. They are alien, unknowable, powerful…
and they will be the doom of you. Kill them, sneak
past them, outrun them, do whatever you have to
to survive. The Intruders you face during extraction
runs, called **baseline**, are relatively weaker and
more predictable than **Boss** Intruders – but they are
oh so numerous…

Intruders are enemies represented by standees
or miniatures and usually take up a single board
space, just like Spacers. An Intruder is defined by
various **attributes** and stat**istics found on their
oversized Intruder Sheet (in the Full Game, this will
be an Intruder Manual book!), as well as Unique
Specimen cards. **Note:** Boss Intruders have additional AI, BP and Trait cards, making them much
more formidable (see Boss Intruders on p. 32).
