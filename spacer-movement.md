# Spacer Movement

The Move action is, generally, used to move your
Spacer around. Each Move action is accompanied
by a numerical value.

When you perform a Move action, you can move
a number of spaces up to that value. First, declare
the space you want to reach, then move your Spacer,
one space at a time, resolving the effects of any
Terrain tiles you travel through.

There are other general rules and restrictions that
apply to all Move actions:

- **All movement is performed in cardinal
  directions. You cannot move diagonally!**
- You **cannot** move through Obstacles, red
  lines, black lines (walls) or onto Out-OfBounds spaces.
- You **cannot** move through Intruders,
  but **you can** move through other Spacers.
- As part of a single movement, you **cannot**
  move onto the same space twice.
- You must end your movement on an empty
  space (a space that does not contain Obstacles, Intruders or other Spacers).
- Most Move actions **make Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg)** (see
  Noise Roll on p. 16).
- If a space shows a Location arrow ![Location Arrow Icon](svg/icon-location-arrow.svg), stop
  on that space and reveal a new Location
  Map (see p. 15).
- If a space shows a forced direction arrow ![Forced Direction Arrow](svg/icon-forced-direction-arrow.svg), 
  that space enforces your movement
  direction; if you’re on that space, you can
  only move in that arrow’s direction.
- Doors on a map are considered closed (or
  welded, p. 41). You cannot move through
  a Door unless it is opened (removed) from
  the board by another effect (like a Console
  or Keycard)

***Spacer Movement Example:** Spacers can only move in cardinal
directions, never diagonally. They cannot move through Intruders or closed doors, but can move through other Spacers.*
