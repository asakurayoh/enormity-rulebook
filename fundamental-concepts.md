# Fundamental Concepts

## Inverted Combat Paradigm

In **Enormity**, the gameplay doesn’t wind down,
it heats up. Your wounds, stress levels and time
running out don’t make you weaker, they make you
soar! Intruders don’t just get beaten, they power up!

Unlike most games, **Enormity** has a distinct heroic
flow that’s always on the uptake. You are playing
heroes facing unimaginable terror, and you will do
whatever it takes to see it through to the end. Each
time you fall, you will stand up stronger. Each time
you’re knocked back, you’ll punch harder.

Against all odds, you will take whatever the cruel
universe throws against you and survive!

In **Enormity**, there’s no defeat snowball effect,
no negative modifiers that keep stacking up, hindering your options and making you a glorified spectator.
There is always a chance at a comeback, the closer
you are to death, or the countdown timer is to zero
hour, the more powerful you become.

This is the heart of the ICP.

The Intruders don’t sit idly by either. They have their
own comeback mechanics: smaller ones you meet
during Extraction Runs will become fiercer the closer
you are to extraction, while boss entities will grow
more dangerous and deadly, the closer you are to
killing them off. This is what we call Escalation.
Some Intruders escalate gradually, while others
completely change forms. The longer the game
goes on, the more wounds the Intruder gains, the
harder it becomes! This means that an opponent
is truly defeated only when the last wound is struck
– or when you extract to the safety of your haven!

This dance is what makes the gameplay of **Enormity**
exciting. Victory is never assured, defeat never inevitable. You must be on your toes at all times and
use all the options at your disposal.

## Hard Co-op

**Enormity** is a cooperative game about a band
of unlikely survivors facing an unknown world of unimaginable horror. Co-op is a big focus, and the hard
co-op mechanics take it to the next level.

Basically, when you perform most actions, you are
also creating opportunities and openings for other
players, either directly, or by leaving special tokens
in the ‘Spacer Pool’, a place for shared resources
that enhance your abilities and attacks and allow
you to trigger special unique effects and stratagems.

You’ll get a taste of this in the demo, but of course the
full game will offer even more options for cooperation!

## Persistent World

**Enormity** can be played as one-off game sessions,
as well as a campaign with a dedicated end or endless exploration.

However, one thing all games of **Enormity** have
in common is world persistency. Your various
extraction runs, adventures and choices will shape
the spaceship Sheperd and influence all future
games by unlocking new areas of the ship, introducing new deadly Intruders, modifying the ever-expanding loot pool, changing the game spaces with
stickers and new permanent rules, and more.

> Note: There is nothing stopping you from hard-resetting the game to a default state and starting
> over (even the stickers are reusable).

## Campaigns

If you like, you may play Enormity as a **campaign**.
This Demo provides you with one ready-to-go
mini-campaign, the Dark Side of the Sun, which
was designed to showcase **Enormity’s** variety
of gameplay (both extraction runs and boss incursions), story-telling potential and modularity.
On page 2 of the Mythos Book you will find details
on how to start this campaign. The Full Game will
offer longer campaigns, as well as rules to run custom campaigns – because a single one will barely
scratch the surface. You will find more details
on how campaigns will work in the **In The Full
Game section**, at the back of this rulebook.
