# Signature And Routine

The Boss Intruder Sheet has two additional, bakedin quasi-protocols: the Signature and the Routine.
These represent the Intruder’s typical behaviors.
The Signature is the “signature attack,” while the
Routine is what it does when there is no one around
to attack.

The Signature is the creature’s iconic default Attack. It behaves like an AI card, but is **not an AI
card**. If another card, Trait or any other effect instructs you to perform Signature, this is the Attack
you should resolve.

The Routine is a special action the creature performs when there is no eligible Target for any of the
targeting lines on its current Attack. Usually, Routines are devastating effects that should be avoided
at all costs!

All Signatures and some Routines are Attacks, but
they are not AI cards for the purpose of any other
effects.
