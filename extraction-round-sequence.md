# Extraction Round Sequence

A single game of Enormity represents one extraction run (or Incursion, see p. 32) that is played
over a series of rounds, and each round consists of
three phases that players resolve in the following
order:

**1. Countdown Phase:** Players move the Countdown
Marker one space down the Countdown Track.
Players resolve any cards and Blips on the current
Countdown space, as well as spawn new Blips.

**2. Spacer Phase:** Each Spacer takes one turn.
Spacers can take their turns in any order they like.
A Spacer may play up to 3 Action cards per turn, as
well as perform any other abilities once.

**3. Intruder Phase:** Players resolve Patrols. Each
Blip and Intruder acts once.
