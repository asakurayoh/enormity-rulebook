**Character card** statistics:

- (1) **Class:** This tells you about your character’s specialization. Others cards may be unlocked or refer to your class. In the full game,
you will be able to develop your class.
- (2) **Skills:** Each character has 5 skills,
Intelligence ![Inteligence Icon](svg/icon-intelligence.svg), Dexterity ![Dexterity Icon](svg/icon-dexterity.svg), Strength ![Strength Icon](svg/icon-strength.svg),
Willpower ![Willpower Icon](svg/icon-willpower.svg), Perception ![Perception Icon](svg/icon-perception.svg), represented by
a numerical value. You will use these Skills
during Skill tests (see Skill Tests on p. 37).
- (3) **Abilities:** Each Spacer has unique abilities that will help them survive (see
Abilities on p. 37).
- (4) **Character Rubicon Bonuses:** Rubicon
bonuses are boons provided to your Spacer
when they perform an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action.
Usually, they take the form of Spacer tokens
you place into the Incoming Spacer Pool (see
Spacer Pool and Spacer Tokens on p. 8).
- (5) **![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) Starting Stress:** This box represents
your starting Stress ![Stress Icon](svg/icon-stress.svg) level. Place your
Stress Indicator on the indicated rubicon
connector space.

**Suit card** statistics:

- (6) **Abilities:** Each Suit has unique abilities
that will help you survive (see Abilities on p. 37).
- **Specs:** Suits provide Spacers with vital survival systems, including:
  - (7) ![Light source Icon](svg/icon-light-source.svg) A light source, used for Scouting
Blips (see Actions, on p.14) and other
gameplay segments, from traversing
a dark corridor to braving the blackness
of open space.
  - (8) ![Slots Icon](svg/icon-slots.svg) Slots for support equipment.
See the Gear, Carrying Slots and Backpack box on p. 12.
  - (9) ![Backpack Icon](svg/icon-backpack.svg) Space in your backpack. See the
Gear, Carrying Slots and Backpack box
on p. 12.
- (10) **Suit Rubicon Bonuses:** Rubicon bonuses are boons provided to your Spacer when
they perform an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action. Usually, they take the form of Spacer tokens you
place into the Incoming Spacer Pool (see
Spacer Pool and Spacer tokens on p. 8).
- (11) **Vitality Levels:** Notice the thin colored
bars beneath the rubicon bonuses track.
These red, orange and green sections represent vitality levels. They don’t do anything
on their own, but other game components
may refer to them e.g. Rudimentary Scanner. Simply put, your vitality level corresponds to the position of the Vitals Indictor.
