# Scavenging

Scavenging is an Adrenaline ![Adrenaline Icon](svg/icon-adrenaline.svg) action that allows
you to search your immediate surroundings, open
Gear Caches, find Engrams, interact with Consoles,
and more. **SCAVENGE** is one of the simpler actions
you can take, as it simply allows you to collect a Gear
Cache, Engram or Objective token on your space,
or interact with a Console on your space **without
spending Spacer Tokens**.

**Note:** As an Adrenaline action, Scavenging raises
your Adrenaline and allows you to leave Spacer tokens!

***Full Game:** In the full game, Scavenging will have
additional uses.*
