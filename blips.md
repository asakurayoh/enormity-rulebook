# Blips

Blip tokens represent anomalous signatures showing up on your built-in scanner. They may just be
electromagnetic static or vermin crawling through
the ducts of the space… or they may be very bad
news. You won’t know until you scout their area
– or until they are on top of you.

Blips move during the Intruder Phase, as part of patrolling (see Blip Patrols on p. 30), but they also **react
to every Noise ![Noise Icon](svg/icon-noise.svg) made**. In other words, whenever
a Spacer, or something else, makes Noise, Blips will
move towards you.

You’d better hope it’s electromagnetic static…
